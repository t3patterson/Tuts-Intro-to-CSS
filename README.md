####1. Jesus where do we start? (10min)
Kind of overwhelming and i don't wanna do this anymore.
We will start with **font-family**
```
body {
    font-family: Helvetica;
}
```
- let's get an easy win and get a seemingly near universaal style.
- all the fonts are 'sans-serif'
  + a 'serif' font has shoes and the 'sans-serif' font does not
- We are going to use Helvetica: a very classic (and classy) sans-serif font
  - most prominent use of Helvetica: the New York Subway System
  - there's even a movie on it
  - I personally find Helvetica highly agreeable, 5 out of 5 stars from me

####A note on css syntax (the basic rule of css)
1. HTML element selector 
2. style-property
3. style-value

Certain styles 'cascade' down to child elements (like font-family, font-color, )

####2. Let's do it again for the exception: (3min)
```
h1 {
    font-family: "Helvetica";
    font-weight: 200;
}
```
