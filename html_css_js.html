      <h3>Hey there</h3>
      <p>This modal window is brought to you by JavaScript. JavaScript code tells the browser's window to listen for the 'scroll' event, and in your code, you also write an action that will occur whenever the event happens.</p> 

      <p>The action that happens in this case is that this window appears if the user has scrolled more than 210px down from the top.</p>
      
      <p><button>Hide me</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(also triggered by JavaScript)</small></p>

Perhaps these cats are just sucking up to Santa Paws for extra catnip in their stockings, or maybe felines have had a true change of heart. Either way, we should all take a tip from these cats that are dominating the Christmas game right meow.      \nBe inspired by the Christmas kitties below, and meowy holidays to you and yours."),

It's never the ones you hope. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. \nShe's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is.\nNo, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. They frame my junk.
